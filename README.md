*Goal*: Lose 10 kg by depleting glycogen (Days 1-2), burning fat (Days 3-5), and sustaining ketosis (Day 6+).

*Key Rules*:  
- Zero carbs: No rice, roti, dal, vegetables, fruits, or sweets.  
- Caloric deficit: 500-1000 kcal below TDEE (e.g., 1200-1700 kcal for 2200 kcal TDEE).  
- Hydration: 2-3L water/day.  
- Electrolytes: 3-5g sodium, 1-2g potassium, 200-400mg magnesium.

*Note*: Consult a doctor before starting.

## Phase 1: Stored Carb Loss (Days 1-2)
*Objective*: Deplete glycogen stores (1-3 kg water weight loss).
